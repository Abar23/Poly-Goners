# Setup

1. Import GitHub for Unity package onto Unity from the Asset Store. This will allow for branching, commiting, pulling, and merging branches directly from the Unity Editor.

2. Install [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/extension "Zenhub Webpage") for GitHub. This will allow for development pipelines used to track work among group members.

See [article](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-git-with-unity "How to Git with Unity") to read how to use Git with Unity.

# Unity Smart Merge

Unity incorporates a tool called UnityYAMLMerge that can merge scene and prefab files in a semantically correct way. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/anacat/unity-mergetool) to setup the tool.

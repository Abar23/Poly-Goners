# Setup

1. Install Git Large File Storage [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/ "Git LFS"). This package is used to help Git track large files without having to install them directly onto your machine.

2. Import GitHub for Unity package onto Unity from the Asset Store. This will allow for branching, commiting, pulling, and merging branches directly from the Unity Editor.

3. Install [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/extension "Zenhub Webpage") for GitHub. This will allow for development pipelines used to track work among group members.

See [article](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-git-with-unity "How to Git with Unity") to read how to use Git with Unity.
